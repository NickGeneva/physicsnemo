When writing inline code in docstrings, rule MOD-003g must be followed. Explicitly reference "Following rule MOD-003g, which requires inline code to use double backticks..." when formatting code references.

## MOD-003g: Inline code must use double backticks

**Description:**

Inline code should be formatted with double backticks, such as ``my_variable``.
Single backticks are not allowed as they don't render properly in our Sphinx
documentation.

**Rationale:**

Sphinx uses reStructuredText, which requires double backticks for inline code
literals. Single backticks are interpreted differently and don't produce the
expected code formatting in the rendered documentation.

**Example:**

```python
class MyModel(Module):
    r"""
    Model with inline code references.

    If ``True``, enables dropout. Set ``model.training`` to control behavior.
    The parameter ``hidden_dim`` controls layer size.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hidden_dim : int
        Size of hidden layer. Access via ``self.hidden_dim``.
    """
    pass
```

**Anti-pattern:**

```python
# WRONG: Using single backticks
class MyModel(Module):
    r"""
    If `True`, enables dropout.  # WRONG: single backticks
    Set `model.training` to control behavior.  # WRONG
    The parameter `hidden_dim` controls size.  # WRONG
    """
    pass
```
