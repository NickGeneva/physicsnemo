When writing method docstrings, rule MOD-003d must be followed. Explicitly reference "Following rule MOD-003d, which requires method docstrings to have Parameters and Returns sections..." when documenting methods.

## MOD-003d: Missing required method docstring sections

**Description:**

All methods should be documented with a docstring, with at least a `Parameters`
section and a `Returns` section. Other sections such as `Notes`, `Examples`, or
`..important::` or `..code-block:: python` are possible. Other sections are not
recognized by our Sphinx documentation and are prohibited.

Note: The forward method is a special case - its full documentation should be in
the class docstring (see MOD-003c), though a concise forward method docstring is
permitted.

**Rationale:**

Complete method documentation ensures users understand how to call methods and
what to expect in return. Standardized sections make documentation consistent
and easier to parse for both humans and AI agents.

**Example:**

```python
def compute_loss(
    self,
    pred: torch.Tensor,
    target: torch.Tensor,
) -> torch.Tensor:
    r"""
    Compute mean squared error loss.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pred : torch.Tensor
        Predicted values of shape :math:`(B, D)`.
    target : torch.Tensor
        Target values of shape :math:`(B, D)`.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        Scalar loss value.
    """
    return torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(pred, target)
```

**Anti-pattern:**

```python
# WRONG: No docstring at all
def helper_method(self, x):
    return x * 2

# WRONG: Using unrecognized section names
def compute_loss(self, pred, target):
    """
    Compute loss.

    Args:
        pred: predicted values
        target: target values

    Returns:
        loss value
    """
    pass
```
